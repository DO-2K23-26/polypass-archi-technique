== Data Structure Schema

== Overview
This document describes the data structure schema for the Search service. The schema is composed of three main entities: `Tag`, `Credential`, and `Folder`. 
The search service will find credentials based on the tags names, folders name or my credential title.

    class Tag {

        name: string
        id_folder: string
    }
    class Credential {
        id: string
        title: string
        tags: Tag[]
        folder: Folder
    }
    class Folder {
        id: string
        name: string
    }
    class User {
        id: string
        id_folders: string[]
    }

== SQL schema

We will deploy an SQL database (PostgreSQL) to store folders, as they are a nested/tree-like structure, which cannot be properly handled for direct search in Elastic's database.  
A query for a folder's ID will return a flat list of all subfolders IDs (and names, optionally).

        int id PK "Primary key"
        string folder_name "Name of the folder"
        int parent_id FK "References folders.id"
    }
