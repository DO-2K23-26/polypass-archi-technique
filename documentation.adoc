== Breakdown

This part concerns the features we want to implement in the Polypass system.

include::src/drafts/lexicon.adoc[Lexicon]

=== User Management

As a guest user:

- I want to create an account.
- I want to log in to my account.

As a connected user:

- I want to log out of my account.
- I want to delete my account.
- I want to be able to change my password.
- I want to be able to change my email address.


=== Credentials Management

As a connected user:

- I want to store the credentials of a website I am using.
- I want to generate a secure password.
- I want to add custom fields to my credentials.
- I want to add a note to my credentials.
- I want to search for credentials by name, websites, identifier and custom fields.
- I want to provide a Master Key to encrypt my credentials.
- I want to view credentials in a tree structure based on folders or tags.

    User --> |Add| D["Context or custom fields"]
....

Here is a class diagram to better understand the relationship between the different entities:

     Folder "1" --> "0..*" Folder : Contains
     User "1" --> "*" Credential
     Credential "*" --> "*" Tag
     Credential "1" --> "*" Folder

=== Credentials Tagging

As a connected admin user:

- I want to tag credentials.
- I want to create, update, or delete my tags.

As a connected viewer:

- I want to search for credentials by tag.

=== Credentials Sharing

As a connected admin user:

- I want to share a credential with a guest user.
- I want to set the date of revocation of the shared credentials.
- I want to set the credential to be only seen one time.
- I want to define a passphrase for the shared credentials.

As a guest:

- I want to access the shared credentials.
- I want to be able to use the passphrase to see the shared credentials.
- I want to be able to copy/paste any field of the shared credentials.

    Guest["Guest"] --> |Use| D
    Guest --> |Copy/Paste| E["Shared credentials fields"]
....

=== Folder

As a connected user:

- I want to create a folder if I am not into a folder.
- I want to accept invitations to join a folder.

As a connected admin user:

- I want to create, update and delete a folder.
- I want to invite a user to a folder.

As a connected viewer:

- I want to view the folders.
- I want to search for credentials by folder.

=== Insights

As a connected viewer:

- I want to see statistics about my passwords, such as:
    - Old passwords.
    - Reused passwords.
    - Weak passwords.
- I want to know if my credentials has been breached.

As a connected admin user:
- I want to view credential usage statistics for a group, such as:
    - credential creation trends.
    - credential usage trends.
- I want to view the credential usage statistics for shared credentials.
